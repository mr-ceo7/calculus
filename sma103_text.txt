Preface
This volume aims to present calculus in an intuitive yet intellectually satisfying way and to illustrate the many applications of calculus to the pure sciences and management sciences. The
only co-requisite for mastering the material in the book are SMA 101: Basic Mathematics and an
interest in mathematics and a willingness occasionally to suspend disbelief when a familiar idea
occurs in an unfamiliar guise. But only an exceptional student would proﬁt from reading the book
unless he/she has previously acquired a fair working knowledge of elementary set theory, algebra
and geometry. This book is a development of various courses designed for ﬁrst year students of
science at the University of Nairobi, whose preparation has been some rudimentary knowledge of
set theory, algebra and geometry.
What is Calculus?
Algebra and geometry are useful tools for describing relationships between static quantities. However, they do not involve concepts appropriate for describing how quantity changes. For this we
need new mathematical operations that transcend or go beyond algebra and geometry. We require
operations that measure the way related quantities change.
Calculus provides the tools for describing motion quantitatively. It introduces two new operations
called diﬀerentiation and integration which are inverses of each other: what diﬀerentiation does,
integration undoes. The process of diﬀerentiation is closely tied to the geometric problem of ﬁnding tangent lines. Integration is related to the geometric problem of ﬁnding areas of regions with
curved boundaries. These two concepts deﬁned in terms of the concept of a limit. This will be
developed in Chapter 1, and marks the beginning of calculus.
Origins of Calculus
Calculus was invented independently by two 17th-century mathematicians: Isaac Newton and
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.
Objectives
At the end of this course unit the learner will be able to:
 Understand a the concept of a limit of a function and how to compute the same.
 Appreciate the concept of a continuous function.
 Appreciate and apply the concepts of derivatives and antiderivatives.

Acknowledgements
This book could not have been written without direct and indirect assistance from many sources.
I had the good fortune of interacting with a number of special people and institutions. I seize this
opportunity to express my gratitude to all of them. It is a pleasure to acknowledge with great
pleasure the encouragement I received for this project from my former students and colleagues at
the University of Nairobi and beyond. I wish to acknowledge, with thanks, my colleagues who
have encouraged me to acquire expert knowledge of the typesetting software LATEX. As always, I
am grateful to the University of Nairobi, whose facilities have made it possible to write this book.
They have also provided an environment that helped me develop academically and professionally
and given me the resources needed to make this book a success. I am also thankful to the School
of Mathematics for giving me the opportunity to teach calculus for years, which has indeed helped
this project to take shape. I would also like to thank the Open and Distance Learning(ODL)
Programme for giving me the opportunity at several review sessions at Multimedia University,
Mbagathi and Kenya Wildlife Training Institute, Naivasha to organize and typeset this book. In
these circumstances it would have been extraordinarily slothful not to produce a book. I read the
galleys myself and checked the calculations in the text. If the book contains any errors or stylistic
misjudgement or shortcomings, they are entirely mine! Last, but not least, I am grateful to my
family for their continuing and unwavering support. To them I dedicate this book.

PRELIMINARIES FOR CALCULUS
Neglect of mathematics works injury to all knowledge, since he who is ignorant of it
cannot know the other sciences or the things of this world. And what is worse, men
who are thus ignorant are unable to perceive their own ignorance and so do not seek
a remedy. —Roger Bacon
Functions are basic to the study of mathematics and many other sciences and are found in everyday
life situations.
To address functions adequately we need to lay a foundation. We start by introducing the notion
of sets.

1.1

Elementary Set Theory

Deﬁnition 1.1.1. A set is any well-deﬁned collection, aggregate, class or conglomerate of objects.
These objects (which may be cities, years, numbers, letters of the alphabet, or anything else) are
called elements of the set, and are often said to be members of the set.
A
⊙set is often speciﬁed by
⊙ listing its elements inside a pair of braces or curly brackets or parentheses.
means of a property of its elements.
Example 1.1.2. The set whose elements are the ﬁrst six letters of the alphabet is written
{a, b, c, d, e, f }
Example 1.1.3. The set whose elements are the even integers between 1 and 11 is written
{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
We can also specify a set by giving a description of its elements (without actually listing the
elements).
Example 1.1.4. The set {a, b, c, d, e, f } can also be written
{T he f irst six letters of the alphabet}

CHAPTER 1. PRELIMINARIES FOR CALCULUS

1.1.1

Notation and Terminology

For convenience, we usually denote sets by capital letters of the alphabet A, B, C and so on. We
use lowercase letters of the alphabet to represent elements of a set. For a set A, we write x ∈ A
if x is a member of A or belongs to A. We write x ̸∈ A to mean that x is not a member of A or
does not belong to A.
Example 1.1.5. If E denotes the set of even integers, then 4 ∈ E but 7 ̸∈ E.
Deﬁnition 1.1.6. An empty set is a set with no elements.
An empty set is usually denoted by ∅. It is a set that arises in a variety of disguises.
Deﬁnition 1.1.7. Let A and B be two sets. If every element of A is an element of B, we say that
A is a subset of B, and we write A ⊆ B. We also say that A is contained in B.
Deﬁnition 1.1.8. If A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, then we say that A and B are equal, and write A = B.
Deﬁnition 1.1.9. If A ⊆ B and A ̸= B, then we say that A is a proper subset of B are equal,
and write A = B, or A is properly contained in B, and write A ⊂ B.
Deﬁnition 1.1.10. (Cardinality of a set). The number of elements in a set A is called the
cardinality of A, and is denoted n(A) or |A|.
Deﬁnition 1.1.11. (Universal set). A universal set denoted by U is a set which contains all
elements under consideration. That is, it contains all other sets under consideration. It is also
called the universe of discourse or simply universe.
1. Complement of a set
Let U be the universal set and A be any set. The complement of A, written A{ is deﬁned as
{
}
{
A = x ∈ U : x ̸∈ A
Example 1.1.12. Let the universal set be U = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} and A = {3, 5}. Then A{ =
{0, 1, 2, 6}.
2. Union of sets
Let A and B be sets. The union of A and B, denoted by A ∪ B is
{
}
A ∪ B = x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B or both
Example 1.1.13. If A = {3, 5, 7} and B = {x, y, t}, them A ∪ B = {3, 5, 7, x, y, t}.
3. Intersection of sets
Let A and B be sets. The intersection of A and B, denoted by A ∩ B is
{
}
A ∩ B = x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B
Example 1.1.14. If A = {1, 3, T om, M ary} and B = {3, x, y, t, M ary}, them A∩B = {3, M ary}.

4. Set Diﬀerence
Let A and B be sets. The set diﬀerence or relative complement of A with respect to B, denoted
by A − B is deﬁned as
{
}
A − B = x : x ∈ A and x ̸∈ B
Example 1.1.15. If A = {N ew Y ork, Cairo, M umbai, Seoul, Beijing, M oscow, London} and
B = {N airobi, Kigali, P retoria, beijing, Harare, P aris, London}. Then
A − B = {N ew Y ork, Cairo, M umbai, Seoul, M oscow}
and
B − A = {N airobi, Kigali, P retoria, Harare, P aris}
5. Cartesian Product of Sets
Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by A × B is deﬁned as
{
}
A × B = (a, b) : a ∈ A and b ∈ B
Example 1.1.16. If A = {0, 1, 2} and B = {a, b}, them
{
}
A × B = (0, a), (0, b), (1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)
{
}
A × A = (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Example 1.1.17. Let R be the set of real numbers. Then the Cartesian product of
{
}
R × R = (x, y) : x, y ∈ R
This is also denoted as R2 and read as ”R two”. This is the two-dimensional Cartesian plane or
simply the xy-plane.
The Cartesian product
{
}
R × R × R = (x, y, z) : x, y, z ∈ R
This is also denoted as R3 and read as ”R three”, and is the three-dimensional Euclidean space.

R = Q ∪ Q{ . The set of real numbers is also called the real number line.
7. Intervals in R. Let a, b, x ∈ R. Then
(a, b) = {x ∈ R : a < x < b} is called the open interval between a and b.
[a, b) = {x ∈ R : a ≤ x < b} and (a, b] = {x ∈ R : ax ≤ b} are called the half-open or half-closed
intervals between a and b.
[a, b] = {x ∈ R : a ≤ x ≤ b} is called the closed interval between a and b.
(a, ∞) = {x ∈ R : x > a}
[a, ∞) = {x ∈ R : x ≥ a}
(−∞, a) = {x ∈ R : x < a}
(−∞, a] = {x ∈ R : x ≤ a}

LIMITS AND CONTINUITY OF

2.1

Functions and their Graphs

Deﬁnition 2.1.1. Let X and Y be two sets. By a function f from X to Y , we mean a rule or
relation which assigns to each x in X a unique element f (x) in Y .
We often express the fact that f is a function from X to Y by writing
f : X −→ Y.
The set X is called the domain of f , and denoted by Dom(f ). The set of values y = f (x) is
called the range of f , and is denoted by Ran(f ). Equivalently, Ran(f ) = {f (x) : x ∈ Dom(f )}
and is always a subset of Y might not equal Y . The set Y is called the co-domain of f . When
we describe a function by writing a formula y = f (x), we call x the independent variable and y
the dependent variable. The set of all values for which f(x) is deﬁned is the domain of f and the
values y = f (x) where x ∈ Dom(f ) is the range of f . The graph of the function f is the set of all
points in the plane of the form (x, f (x)), where x ∈ Dom(f ).
Deﬁnition 2.1.2. We say that a function f : X −→ Y is one-to-one or injective if, for every
pair x1 , x2 ∈ X, x1 ̸= x2 , implies that f (x1 ) ̸= f (x2 ) (or equivalently, if f (x1 ) = f (x2 ), then
x1 = x2 ).
Deﬁnition 2.1.3. A function f : X −→ Y is onto or surjective if, every y ∈ Y is of the form
f (x) for some x ∈ X. Equivalently, f is onto if Ran(f ) = Y .
Deﬁnition 2.1.4. A function f : X −→ Y is a bijection if it is one-to-one and onto.
Example 2.1.5. The function f : R −→ R given by f (x) = 2x is one-to-one and onto, and hence
it is a bijection.
Deﬁnition 2.1.6. If a function f : X −→ Y is a bijection then there exists an inverse function
f −1 : Y −→ X. For every y ∈ Y there exists a unique element x ∈ X deﬁned by x = f −1 (y).

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS

Domain and Range of Functions

We now consider functions f : X −→ Y for which X and Y subsets of real numbers R. Such
functions are said to be real-valued.
Example 2.1.7. For the function f with the formula y = f (x) = 2x, Dom(f ) = R and Ran(f ) =
R.

Figure 2.1: Graph ofy = f (x) = 2x

Example 2.1.8. For the function f with the formula y = f (x) =
−3 ≤ x ≤ 3} = [−3, 3] and Ran(f ) = {y ∈ R : y ≤ 3} = (−∞, 3].

It is easy to see that Dom(f ) = {x ∈ R : x ̸= 1} = R − {1}. Since y = x−1

and the only value of ywhich will not occur is y = −1, for which the denominator is zero. Hence

2.1.2

Some Elementary Functions

1. Polynomials. A real polynomial is a function whose domain is the set of real numbers,
deﬁned by
f (x) = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + ... + an xn
where a0 , a1 , ..., an are real constants(called the coeﬃcients of f and an ̸= 0). The integer n is called
the degree of the polynomial, and denoted by n = deg(f ). Polynomials of degree 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are
called constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic and quintic, respectively. For example,
f (x) = 4 − x2 + 6x8 is a polynomial of degree 8, g(x) = 2 is a polynomial of degree 0 or a constant
polynomial.
2. Rational Functions. A rational function f (x) is a quotient of two polynomials. That is
2
f (x) = p(x)
, where p and q are polynomials and g(x) ̸= 0. For example, f (x) = xx3 −1
is a rational
q(x)
+1
function.
3. Trigonometric and Inverse Trigonometric Functions. The three basic trigonometric functions are sine, cosine and tangent. Reciprocals of these functions are secant = 1/cosine, cosecant =
1/sine, cotangent = 1/tangent. The inverses are arcsine, arccosine, arctangent and arcotangent.
4. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions. An exponential function is of the form y =
f (x) = ax , where x is a variable, and a is a constant. The domain of f is the real line R = (−∞, ∞)
and Ran(f ) = (0, ∞). When a = e, then f (x) = ex .
The logarithm function is given by y = f (x) = loga x and its domain is (0, ∞) and its range is
R = (−∞, ∞). The constant a is referred to as the base of the logarithm function. The logarithm

function with base a = e is called the natural logarithm or Naperian logarithm, and denoted by
ln x.
The following laws of logarithms are easy to derive from the laws of exponents:
• loga xy = loga x + loga y
• loga xy = loga x − loga y
• loga xα = α loga x, x any real number
bx
• loga x = log
logb a
These formulae hold for any positive x, y, a, b(a ̸= 1, b ̸= 1).

Limits of Functions

2.2.1

Informal Deﬁnition of a Limit

Deﬁnition 2.2.1. (Informal definition of a limit) A function f (x) is said to have a limit
L as x approaches (or tends to) a if the values of f (x) can be made as close as we like to L by
taking x suﬃciently close to a(but not equal to a). We use the two notations:
limx→a f (x) = L, read as ” the limit of f (x) as x tends to a is equal to L” or
f (x) −→ L as x −→ a, read as ”f(x) tends to L as x tends to a”.
Remarks. It is assumed that the domain of f includes an interval containing a, but not necessarily
a itself. This deﬁnition is informal because phrases such as ”close as we want” and ”close
enough” are imprecise; the meaning depends on the context. To a machinist manufacturing
pistons, close enough may mean within a few thousandths of an inch. To an astronomer studying
distant galaxies, close enough may mean within a few thousand light years. This deﬁnition should
be clear enough, however, to enable us recognize and evaluate limits of speciﬁc functions.
Some limits are easy to compute but others are not so easy to evaluate. Limits of polynomials
are found by substitution. Limits of (many but not all) rational functions can be found by
substitution. Many situations require algebraic manipulation before applying the limits
Example 2.2.2. Find limx→0 3x2 − 2x + 1
Solution. As x tends to 0, it is evident that f (x) approaches 3(0)2 − 2(0) + 1 = 1.

Solution. As x tends to −5, it is evident that f (x) approaches 3(−5)+1
= 73 .

Remark. When we say that f (x) has a limit L as x approaches a, we are really saying that we
can ensure that the error |f (x) − L| will be less than any allowed tolerance, no matter how small
by taking x close enough to a (but not equal to a). It is traditional to use ϵ, the Greek letter
”epsilon” for the error |f (x) − L| and δ, the Greek letter ”delta” for the diﬀerence |x − a| that
measures how close x is within that tolerance.

2.2.2

Formal (ϵ − δ) Deﬁnition of a Limit

Deﬁnition 2.2.4. (Formal(ϵ−δ) Deﬁnition of a Limit) We say that a function f (x) approaches
the limit L as x approaches a, and write limx→a f (x) = L if for every number ϵ > 0, there exists
a number δ > 0, possibly depending on ϵ, such that if 0 < |x − a| < δ then |f (x) − L| < ϵ.

Figure 2.5: Limit of f(x) as x−→ a

Remark. Note that the formal deﬁnition of a limit does not tell us how to ﬁnd the limit of a
function, but it does enable us to verify a suspected limit is correct.
If limx→a f (x) ̸= L, then there is an ϵ > 0 such that for every δ > 0 there is an x ∈ R with
0 < |x − a| < δ and |f (x) − L| ≥ ϵ.
Example 2.2.5. Verify that limx→2 3x + 1 = 7.
Solution. Let Let ϵ > 0 be given. We want to ﬁnd δ > 0 so that if 0 < |x − a| < δ then
|f (x) − L| < ϵ.
Now, |f (x) − 7| = |3x + 1 − 7| = |3x − 6| = 3|x − 2| < ϵ whenever |x − 2| < δ. This means that
|x − 2| < 13 ϵ. Now, if we choose δ = 13 ϵ, we will have shown that limx→2 3x + 1 = 7.
Note that the value δ = 31 ϵ is not the only value that will make the implication |f (x) − 7| =
|3x + 1 − 7| = |3x − 6| = 3|x − 2| < ϵ whenever |x − 2| < δ hold. Any smaller positive δ will do
as well. The deﬁnition does not work for a ”best” δ, just one that will work. We can thus choose
.
δ ≤ 31 ϵ
Example 2.2.6. Verify that limx→2 x2 = 4.

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS

Solution. Let ϵ > 0 be given. We want to ﬁnd δ > 0 so that if 0 < |x − a| < δ then
|f (x) − L| < ϵ.
Now, |f (x) − 4| = |x2 − 4| = |(x + 2)(x − 2)| = |x + 2||x − 2|.
We want the expression above to be less than ϵ. We can make the factor |x − 2| as small as
we wish/please by choosing δ properly, but we need to control the factor |x + 2| so that it does
not become too large. If we assume that δ ≤ 1(there is nothing special about 1. Another
positive number could be used and not change the nature of the argument, the details would be
diﬀerent,however. But for convenience, it is customary to always select/choose δ to be less than
or equal to 1) and require that |x − 2| < δ, then we have
|x − 2| < 1 =⇒ 1 < x < 3 =⇒ 3 < x + 2 < 5 =⇒ |x + 2| < 5.
Therefore |f (x) − 4| < 5|x − 2| if |x − 2| ≤ 1. But 5|x − 2| < ϵ if |x − 2| < 5ϵ .
Therefore, if we take δ = min{1, 5ϵ }, then |f (x) − 4| < 5|x − 2| < 5 5ϵ = ϵ if |x − 2| ≤ δ. This proves
that limx→2 x2 = 4.
Example 2.2.7. Use the ϵ − δ deﬁnition of a limit to prove that limx→3 x2 = 9.
Solution. Here f (x) = x2 and L = 9, so that
|f (x) − L| = |x2 − 9| = |(x + 3)(x − 3)| = |x + 3||x − 3|

...............(⋆)

.
To make |f (x) − L| small, one must control the size of |x − 3|. If by agreement we choose δ ≤ 1
and as a consequence the statement, ”x is near 3” is to mean that x is restricted to the closed
interval [2, 4]. That is, 2 ≤ x ≤ 4. This information allows us to place bounds upon the factor
|x + 3|. That is |x + 3| < 7. Thus (⋆) becomes
|f (x) − L| = |x2 − 9| = |(x + 3)(x − 3)| = |x + 3||x − 3| < 7δ < ϵ

...............(⋆⋆),

where ϵ > 0 and less than 1, is as small as you want it to be.
The inequality (⋆⋆) tells us that if δ < 7ϵ , then it follows that |x2 − 9| < ϵ whenever |x − 3| < δ.
So here if we choose δ = min{1, 7ϵ }, then we are done.
Remark. The ϵ − δ deﬁnition of a limit was developed around the 1800′ s and it resulted from
the combined research developed by mathematicians Weierstrass, Bolzano and Cauchy.

where L1 , L2 ∈ R, then

[Constant Multiple Rule]

[Quotient Rule]

Proof.(1) and (2) and (4) are easy to prove.
(3). Suppose limx→a f (x) = L1 and limx→a g(x) = L2 . Given ϵ > 0 there exists δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0
such that
ϵ
0 < |x − a| < δ1 =⇒ |f (x) − L1 | <
2
and
ϵ
0 < |x − a| < δ2 =⇒ |g(x) − L2 | < .
2
Note also that if limx→a g(x) = L2 , then 0 < |x − a| < δ2 =⇒ |g(x) − L2 | < ϵ. Letting ϵ = 1 in
this deﬁnition we have that 0 < |x − a| < δ2 =⇒ |g(x) − L2 | < 1 or 0 < |x − a| < δ2 =⇒ −1 <
g(x) − L2 < 1. Equivalently, 0 < |x − a| < δ2 =⇒ −1 + L2 < g(x) < 1 + L2 and hence
0 < |x − a| < δ2 =⇒ |g(x)| < |1 + L2 | ≤ 1 + |L2 |.....................(⋆)
Then

|f (x)g(x) − L1 L2 | =
|f (x)g(x) − L1 g(x) + L1 g(x) − L1 L2 |
=
|(f (x) − L1 )g(x) + L1 (g(x) − L2 )|
≤
|(f (x) − L1 )g(x)| + |L1 (g(x) − L2 )|
= |g(x)||f (x) − L1 | + |L1 ||g(x) − L2 | ≤ 2ϵ + 2ϵ = ϵ.

Therefore limx→a [f (x).g(x)] = L1 .L2 .

Remark. Many situations require algebraic manipulation before the limit theorems can be applied.

(b). limx→0 x+4−2

Solution.(a). The function xx−3
is not deﬁned when x = 3, since direct substitution gives 00 ,
which is undeﬁned. That causes no diﬃculty, since the limit as x approaches 3 depends only on
the values of x near 3 and excludes consideration of the values at x = 3 itself. To evaluate the
limit, note that x2 − 9 = (x − 3)(x + 3). So for x ̸= 3,
(x − 3)(x + 3)
x2 − 9

Remarks. Note that if x approaches a and the values of f (x) do not approach a speciﬁc number,
then we say that the limit of f (x) as x approaches a does not exist.

2.3.1

Right-Hand Limits and Left-Hand Limits

Sometimes the values of a function f (x) tend to diﬀerent limits as x approaches a number a from
diﬀerent sides. When this happens, we call the limit of f as x approaches a from the right the
right-hand limit of f at a, and the limit of f as x approaches a from the left the left-hand
limit of f at a. We use the notation
limx→a+ f (x)

(”the limit of f as x approaches a from the right”).

limx→a− f (x)

(”the limit of f as x approaches a from the left”).

Deﬁnition 2.3.3. A function f (x) has a limit L as x approaches a if and only if the right-hand
and left-hand limits at a exist and are equal.
That is, limx→a f (x) = L iﬀ limx→a+ f (x) = L and limx→a− f (x) = L.
Example 2.3.4. Consider the function

 x + 2, f or x < 1
4
f or x = 1
f (x) =

x + 4 f or x > 1
Show that f has no limit as x → 1.
Solution. Clearly,
lim f (x) = 3 ̸= lim+ f (x) = 5.

x→1−

x→1

Thus the two one-sided limits exits but are not equal. Thus limx→1 f (x) does not exist.

x→0

x→0

x→0

Notice that f (0) = 5 and is not equal to limx→0 f (x). Also note that the limit from the left and
the limit from the right equal limx→0 f (x).
Whenever a limit at a point exists, it is equal to the right-hand and left-hand limits. Also, whenever the right-hand and left-hand limits at a point both exist and are equal, the limit exists and
is equal to the common value of the right-hand and left-hand limits.
Example 2.3.6. Use the ϵ − δ deﬁnition of a limit to prove that the limit of a sum is the sum of
the limits
lim [f (x) + g(x)] = lim f (x) + lim g(x) = L1 + L2 .
x→a

x→a

x→a

Solution. By hypothesis, limx→a f (x) = L1 and limx→a g(x) = L2 , so that for a small number
ϵ > 0, there exists δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 such that
|f (x) − L1 | <

ϵ
when 0 < |x − a| < δ1

and

ϵ
when 0 < |x − a| < δ2

|g(x) − L2 | <

|(f (x) + g(x)) − (L1 + L2 )| =

Therefore |(f (x) + g(x)) − (L1 + L2 )| < ϵ when 0 < |x − a| < δ, which implies that
lim [f (x) + g(x)] = lim f (x) + lim g(x) = L1 + L2 .

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS

Formal Deﬁnition of One-sided Limits
Deﬁnition 2.3.7. The limit of f (x) as x approaches a from the right is the number L if the
given ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
a < x < a + δ implies |f (x) − L| < ϵ.
Deﬁnition 2.3.8. The limit of f (x) as x approaches a from the left is the number L if the
given ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
a − δ < x < a implies |f (x) − L| < ϵ.
Remark. By comparing the two inequalities above, we can see the relation between the one-sided
limits and the two-sided limit. If we subtract a from the δ-inequalities, they become
0 < x − a < δ =⇒ |f (x) − L| < ϵ
and
−δ < x − a < 0 =⇒ |f (x) − L| < ϵ.
Together, these two inequalities say the same thing as
0 < |x − a| < δ =⇒ |f (x) − L| < ϵ,
which is the deﬁnition of the limit. In other words, f (x) has a limit L at a if and only if the
right-hand and left-hand limits of f at a exist and are equal.

2.3.2

Limits at Inﬁnity and Inﬁnite Limits

In this subsection, we study two types of limits
• limits at inﬁnity, where x becomes arbitrarily large, positive or negative;
• inﬁnite limits, which are not really limits at all but provide useful symbolism for describing the
behaviour of functions whose values become arbitrarily large, positive or negative.

2.3. PROPERTIES OF LIMITS

15

Limits at Inﬁnity
Example 2.3.9. Consider the function f (x) = √xx2 +1 .

Figure 2.6: Limit of f(x) as x−→±∞
The values of f (x) seem to approach 1 as x takes on larger and larger positive values and −1
as x takes on negative values that get larger and larger in absolute value. This is equivalent to
saying that limx→∞ f (x) = 1 and limx→−∞ f (x) = −1.
The graph of f conveys this limiting behaviour by approaching the horizontal lines y = 1 as
x → ∞ and y = −1 as x → −∞. These lines are called horizontal asymptotes of the graph. In
general if a curve approaches a straight line as it recedes very far away from the origin, that line
is called an asymptote of the curve.
Deﬁnition 2.3.10. (Informal Deﬁnition of Limits at ∞ and −∞).
If the function f is deﬁned on an open interval (a, ∞) and we can ensure that f (x) is as close as
we want to the limit L by taking x large enough, then we say that f (x) approaches the limit L as
x approaches inﬁnity, and write
lim f (x) = L.
x→∞

If the function f is deﬁned on an open interval (a, ∞) and we can ensure that f (x) is as close as
we want to the limit L by taking x negative and large enough in absolute value, then we say that
f (x) approaches the limit L as x approaches negative inﬁnity, and write
lim f (x) = L.

x→−∞

Recall that the symbol ∞ does not represent a real number. We can not use it in arithmetic in the
usual way, but we can use the phrase ”approaches ∞” to mean ”becomes arbitrarily large positive”
and the phrase ”approaches −∞” to mean ”becomes arbitrarily large negative”.

16

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS

Example 2.3.11. We can see that limx→±∞ x1 = 0, and the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote of
the graph of y = f (x) = x1 .

Figure 2.7: Limit of f(x) as x−→±∞

We use algebraic manipulation/tricks to evaluate such limits.
Example 2.3.12. Evaluate limx→∞ f (x) and limx→−∞ f (x) for f (x) = √xx2 −1 .
Solution. Rewrite the expression for f (x) as follows:
f (x) = √

The factor 1 + x12 −→ 1 as x −→ ∞ or −∞. So f (x) must have the same limit as x −→ ±∞
as does sgn(x). Therefore limx→∞ f (x) = 1 and limx→−∞ f (x) = −1.

2.3.3

Limits at Inﬁnity for Rational Functions

The only polynomials that have limits at ±∞ are constant ones, p(x) = c. The situation is more
interesting for rational functions. Recall that a rational function is a quotient of two polynomials.
The following examples show how to render such a function in a form where its limits at inﬁnity
and negative inﬁnity (if they exist) are apparent. The way to do this is to divide the numerator
and denominator by the highest power of x appearing in the denominator. The limits of a rational
function at inﬁnity and negative inﬁnity either both fail to exist or both exist and are equal.
We consider several cases
(a). Numerator and Denominator of the same degree. Divide the numerator and
denominator by highest power of x, appearing in the denominator and apply the limit.

Inﬁnite Limits
A function whose values grow arbitrarily large can sometimes be said to have an inﬁnite limit.
Since inﬁnity is not a number, inﬁnite limits are not really limits at all.
Example 2.3.16. limx→0 x12 = ∞.
Thus the limit does not exist(DNE) because the function x12 becomes arbitrarily large near x = 0.
Changing Variables with Substitutions
Sometimes a change of variable can turn an unfamiliar expression into one whose limit we know
how to ﬁnd.
Example 2.3.17. Compute limx→∞ sin x1 .
Solution. If we substitute θ = x1 then θ → 0+ as x → ∞. Thus

The Sandwich or Squeeze Theorem

Theorem 2.3.18. (The Sandwich or Squeeze Theorem) Suppose that
g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x)
for all x ̸= a in some interval about a and that
lim g(x) = lim h(x) = L.

x→a

x→a

Then limx→a f (x) = L.

Figure 2.8: Sandwich or Squeeze Concept
Proof. Suppose g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x), and limx→a g(x) = limx→a h(x) = L. Then given ϵ > 0 there
exist δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 such that
ϵ
0 < |x − a| < δ1 =⇒ |g(x) − L| <
3
and

ϵ
0 < |x − a| < δ2 =⇒ |h(x) − L| < .
3
Letting δ = min{δ1 , δ2 }, we have
0 < |x − a| < δ =⇒ |f (x) − L| =
|f (x) − g(x) + g(x) − L|
≤
|f (x) − g(x)| + |g(x) − L|
≤
|h(x) − g(x)| + |g(x) − L|
= |h(x) − L − (g(x) − L)| + |g(x) − L|
≤ |h(x) − L| + |g(x) − L| + |g(x) − L|
ϵ
+ 3ϵ + 3ϵ = ϵ.
=
3
This proves that limx→a f (x) = L.
Remark. The idea is that if the values of f are sandwiched between the values of of two functions
that approach L, then the values of f approach L.
Example 2.3.19. The value of limθ→0 sinθ θ can be found by the Sandwich Theorem. We sandwich
sin θ
between the number 1 and a fraction that is known to approach 1 as θ → 0. This tells us that
θ
sin θ
approaches 1 as well.

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS

2.4

Continuous Functions

We ﬁrst deﬁne the notion of continuity of a function in terms of limits and then a few equivalent
deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 2.4.1. Suppose that a function f is deﬁned on a subset A of R and x ∈ A. If
limx→a f (x) exists and if limx→a f (x) = f (a), then we say that f is continuous at a.
A function f is continuous on A(its domain) if it is continuous at each point a ∈ A(its domain).
Remark. Brieﬂy, continuity of a function f at a means that the limit of f at the point a is equal
to the value of f at a. In other words, when x is close to a, then f (x) is close to f (a).

2.4.1

continuity Test and Points of Discontinuity

Continuity Test: For a function f to be continuous at a, it must satisfy the following three
conditions:
1. f must be deﬁned at a;
2. the limit, limx→a f (x), must exist(i.e < ∞);
3. limx→a f (x must equal f (a).
If any one of these conditions is not satisﬁed, then f is not continuous at a.
Deﬁnition 2.4.2. If a functionf is not continuous at a, we say that it is discontinuous at a, or
that a is a discontinuity of f or a point of discontinuity of f .

2.4.2

Formal (ϵ − δ) Deﬁnition of Continuity

Deﬁnition 2.4.3. (Formal or ϵ − δ deﬁnition of continuity) A function f is continuous at
a ∈ A if for any ϵ > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ A
|x − a| < δ implies that |f (x) − f (a)| < ϵ.
Example 2.4.4. Verify that the function f : R −→ R deﬁned by f (x) = 2x is continuous on R.
Solution. Let ϵ > 0 be given such that |x − y| < δ =⇒ |f (x) − f (y)| < ϵ. That is
|f (x) − f (y)|
|2x − 2y|
2|x − y|
|x − y|

< ϵ
< ϵ
< ϵ
< 2ϵ

So, if we choose δ ≤ 2ϵ will have shown that f is continuous on R.

2.4. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

2.4.3

21

Types of Discontinuities

Remark. Note that in the formal deﬁnition of continuity of a function f , the number δ = δ(x, ϵ)
is a function of the point x and ϵ. If δ = δ(ϵ) a function of ϵ only, we say that f is uniformly
continuous.
Deﬁnition 2.4.5. If at a point a ∈ A the limit limx→a f (x) exists, but f (a) either is not deﬁned
or limx→a f (x) ̸= f (a), then a is a removable point of discontinuity. In other words, f is
discontinuous at a but can be re-deﬁned at that single point so that it becomes continuous there.
Example 2.4.6. The function
f (x) = {

x3 , if x ̸= 0
2, if x = 0,

is discontinuous at a = 0 and limx→0 f (x) = 0 so that limx→0 f (x) ̸= f (0). Thus the point 0 is a
removable point of discontinuity. To remove it, deﬁne f (0) = 0.
Deﬁnition 2.4.7. If f is discontinuous at a point a ∈ A and one-sided limits f (a− ) and f (a+ )
both exists, but f (a− ) ̸=f(a+ ), then f is said to have a discontinuity of the ﬁrst kind or jump
discontinuity.

Figure 2.9: Jump Discontinuity at a

Example 2.4.8. The function
f (x) = {

x,
if x < 1
3x2 − 1, if x ≥ 1

is discontinuous at a = 1, the left-hand and right-hand limits of f at 1 both exists and limx→1− f (x) =
1 ̸= 2 = limx→1+ f (x). Thus the point 1 is a jump discontinuity.

22

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS

Deﬁnition 2.4.9. If at a ∈ A, at least one of the one-sided limits does not exist or is inﬁnite,
then we say that the point a is a discontinuity discontinuity of the second kind.

Figure 2.10: Discontinuity of the Second Kind at a

2.4.4

Right Continuity and Left Continuity

Deﬁnition 2.4.10. A function f is continuous from the right(from the left) at the point a if the
following two conditions are satisﬁed:
(
)
1. limx→a+ f (x) = f (a+ ) limx→a− f (x) = f (a− ) ;
(
)
2. f (a+ ) = f (a) f (a− ) = f (a) .
Clearly a function f is continuous at a if it is both right continuous and left continuous at a.
Remark. Clearly, a function f is continuous at a point a provided that, roughly speaking, its
graph has no breaks( gaps or holes) as it passes the point (a, f (a)). That is, f is continuous at a
if we can draw the graph through (a, f (a)) without lifting our pencil from the paper.
Remark. Clearly the sine and cosine functions are continuous for every value of x tangent function
is continuous where it is deﬁned(its domain), polynomials are continuous at every point, rational
functions are continuous wherever they are deﬁned, the absolute-value function is continuous, all
m
rational powers x n are continuous, exponential and logarithmic functions, hyperbolic functions
are continuous.

2.4.5

then |(x2 + 3x) − 10| < ϵ. That is, |(x − 2)(x + 5)| < ϵ. Let δ ≤ 1. Then |x − 2| < 1 implies
that 1 ≤ x ≤ 3 and hence |x + 5| ≤ 8. Thus 0 < |x − 2| < δ then 8|(x − 2)| < ϵ and thus
|x − 2| < 8ϵ . Hence, if we take δ to be the minimum of 1 and 8ϵ , then whenever 0 < |x − 2| < δ,

DIFFERENTIATION OF FUNCTIONS
OF A SINGLE VARIABLE
Two fundamental problems are considered in calculus:
• The problem of slopes is concerned with ﬁnding the slope of (the tangent line to) a given
curve at a given point on the curve.
• The problem of areas is concerned with ﬁnding the area of a plane region bounded by curves
and straight lines.
The solution of the problem of slopes is the subject of diﬀerential calculus. As we will see, it has
many applications in mathematics and other disciplines.
The problem of areas is the subject of integral calculus, which we begin in Chapter 4.

3.1

Tangent Lines and Their Slopes

3.1.1

Tangent Lines

Conditions for Tangency to a Curve at a Point
Let C be the graph of a function y = f (x) and let P be the point (x0 , y0 ) on C, so that y0 = f (x0 ).
What do we mean when we say that the line L is tangent to C at P ?
Note that a tangent line L should have the ”same direction” as the curve does at the point of
tangency P .

27

28

CHAPTER 3. DIFFERENTIATION OF FUNCTIONS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE

A reasonable deﬁnition of tangency can be stated in terms of limits. If Q is a point on C diﬀerent
from P , then the line through P and Q is called a secant line to the curve. This line rotates
around P as Q moves along the curve. If L is a line through P whose slope is the limit of the slopes
of these secant lines P Q as Q approaches P along C, then we will say that L is tangent to C at P .

Figure 3.1: Secant lines PQ approach tangent line L as Q approaches P along the curve C

The slope of the line P Q is

f (x0 + h) − f (x0 )
.
h
Note that h can be positive or negative, depending on whether Q is to the right or left of P .
Deﬁnition 3.1.1. Suppose f is continuous at x = x0 and that
f (x0 + h) − f (x0 )
= m,
h→0
h
lim

exists. Then the straight line having slope m and passing through the point P = (x0 , f (x0 )) is
called the tangent line (or simply the tangent) to the graph of y = f (x) at P . An equation of
this tangent is
y = m(x − x0 ) + y0 .

3.1. TANGENT LINES AND THEIR SLOPES

Example 3.1.2. Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve y = x2 at the point (1, 1).

Accordingly, the equation of the tangent line at (1, 1) is y = 2(x − 1) + 1 or y = 2x − 1.

3.1.2

The Slope of a Curve

Deﬁnition 3.1.3. The slope of a curve C at a point P is the slope of the tangent line to C at P
if such a tangent line exists. In particular, the slope of the graph of y = f (x) at the point x0 is
f (x0 + h) − f (x0 )

CHAPTER 3. DIFFERENTIATION OF FUNCTIONS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE

The average rate of change in a quantity over a period of time is the amount of change divided
by the time it takes. For instance, average speed is distance traveled divided by the elapsed time,
say, in km/hour,etc.

3.2

The Derivative

Deﬁnition 3.2.1. The derivative of a function f is another function f ′ (read as ”f prime”)
deﬁned by
f (x + h) − f (x)
f ′ (x) = lim
h→0
h
at all points x for which the limit exists (i.e., is a ﬁnite real number). If f ′ (x) exists, we say that
f is diﬀerentiable at x otherwise, it is said to be non-diﬀerentiable at x.
Remark. Note that the domain of f ′ is the subset of dom(f ) where f ′ is deﬁned. That is, The
domain of the derivative f ′ is the set of numbers x in the domain of f where the graph of f
has a non-vertical tangent line. Dom(f ′ ) of f ′ may be smaller than dom(f ) because it contains
only those points in dom(f ) at which f is diﬀerentiable. Values of x in dom(f ) where f is not
diﬀerentiable and that are not endpoints of dom(f ) are singular points of f .
Remark. The value of the derivative of f at a particular point x0 can be expressed as a limit in
either of two ways:
f (x0 + h) − f (x0 )
f (x) − f (x0 )
= lim
.
x→x0
h→0
h
x − x0

f ′ (x0 ) = lim

In the second limit x0 +h is replaced by x, so that h = x−x0 and h → 0 is equivalent to x → x0 . The
process of calculating the derivative f ′ of a given function f is called diﬀerentiation. A function
is diﬀerentiable on a set S if it is diﬀerentiable at every point x in S. Polynomial functions are
diﬀerentiable, as are rational functions and trigonometric functions (in their domains). Composites
of diﬀerentiable functions are diﬀerentiable, and so are sums, diﬀerences, products, powers, and
quotients of diﬀerentiable functions, where deﬁned. Derivatives are the functions we use to measure
the rates at which things change.

Leibniz Notation

Because functions can be written in diﬀerent ways, it is useful to have more than one notation for
derivatives. If y = f (x), we can use the dependent variable y to represent the function, and we
can denote the derivative of the function with respect to x in any of the following ways:
Dx y = y ′ =

d
dy
=
f (x) = f ′ (x) = Dx f (x) = Df (x).
dx
dx

Often the most convenient way of referring to the derivative of a function given explicitly as an
d
expression in the variable x is to write dx
(read ad ”d dx”) in front of that expression. The symbol
d
is a diﬀerential operator and should be read ”the derivative with respect to x of . . .” The

the point (x + h, f (x + h)) on the graph of f .

3.2.3

Diﬀerentiability and Continuity

Recall that we have deﬁned diﬀerentiability of a function f (x) at x0 in terms of a limit. If this
limit does not exists, then we said that f is non-diﬀerentiable at x = x0 . Geometrically, the
non-diﬀerentiability of f at x = x0 can manifest itself in several diﬀerent ways. First of all, the
graph of f (x) could have no tangent line at x = x0 . Secondly, the graph could have a vertical
tangent line at x = x0 .
Closely related to the concept of diﬀerentiability is the concept of continuity. Note that every
diﬀerentiable function at x = a is continuous there. However, a function may be continuous at
x = a but still not be diﬀerentiable there. For instance, the absolute value function f (x) = |x| is
continuous on R but not diﬀerentiable at x = 0.
Theorem 3.2.2. (Diﬀerentiability implies continuity). If a function f is diﬀerentiable at
x, then f is continuous at x.
Proof. Since f is diﬀerentiable at x, we know that
f (x + h) − f (x)
= f ′ (x)

This is equivalent to
lim f (x + h) = f (x),

h→→0

which says that f is continuous at x.

3.3

Diﬀerentiation Rules

If every derivative had to be calculated directly from the deﬁnition(Method of First Principles),
calculus would indeed be a painful subject. In this section we show how to diﬀerentiate functions rapidly-without having to apply the deﬁnition each time. We now give several examples of
the calculation of derivatives algebraically from the deﬁnition of derivative(by Method of First
Principles). Some of these are the basic building blocks from which more complicated derivatives
can be calculated later.

Theorem 3.3.1. (Rule 1: Derivative of a Constant and a Linear Function)
If f (x) = ax + b, then f ′ (x) = a.

Proof. Using the deﬁnition (First Principles)
f ′ (x) =
=

(x)
limh→0 f (x+h)−f
h

limh→0 a(x+h)+b−(ax+b)
h

= limh→0 ah
= a.
h
A consequence of this result is that the derivative of a constant function is zero. That is, if
g(x) = c (constant), then g ′ (x) = 0.

Theorem 3.3.2. (Rule 2: Derivative of a Power Function)
If f (x) = xr , then f ′ (x) = rxr−1 , when xr makes sense as a real number.

Note that to get to the last line of the proof, we have used the fact that g is continuous(since it

Theorem 3.3.7. (Rule 6: The Chain Rule)
If f f (u) is diﬀerentiable at u = g(x), and g(x) is diﬀerentiable at x, then the composite function
f ◦ g(x) = f (g(x)) is diﬀerentiable at x, and (f ◦ g)′ (x) = f ′ (g(x))g ′ (x).

3.3. DIFFERENTIATION RULES

Proof 1. Suppose that f is diﬀerentiable at the point u = g(x) and that g is diﬀerentiable at x.
Let the function E(k) be deﬁned by
E(0) =
E(k) =

0,
f (u+k)−f (u)
= f ′ (u),
k

if k ̸= 0.

By the deﬁnition of derivative, limk→0 E(k) = f ′ (u) − f ′ (u) = 0 = E(0), and so E(k) is continuous
at k = 0. Also, whether k = 0 or not, we have
f (u + k) − f (u) = (f ′ (u) + E(k))k.
Now, put u = g(x) and k = g(x + h) − g(x), so that u + k = g(x + h), and obtain
f (g(x + h)) − f (g(x)) = (f ′ (g(x) + E(k))(g(x + h) − g(x)).
Since g is diﬀerentiable at x, limh→0 g(x+h)−g(x)
= g ′ (x).
h
Also, g is continuous at x, so limh→0 k = limh→0 (g(x + h) − g(x)) = 0. Since E is continuous at 0,
limh→0 E(k) = limk→0 E(k) = E(0) = 0.
Hence
f (g(x+h))−f (g(x))
[f (g(x))]′ =
lim

[f (g(x))]′ =

(g(x)) (g(x+h)−g(x))
limh→0 f (g(x+h))−f

.
limh→0 f (u+k)−f
k
h

= f ′ (u)g ′ (x) = f ′ (g(x))g ′ (x).
Idea of the proof. Introduce g(x+h)−g(x)in the numerator and denominator and let g(x) = u
and g(x + h) = u + k. Note k→ 0 as h → 0.
Remark. The Chain Rule tells us how to diﬀerentiate composites of functions whose derivatives
we already know. If y = f (u), where u = g(x), then y = f (g(x)) and:
dy
times as fast as u is changing;
at u, y is changing du
times as fast as x is changing.
at x, u is changing du
dx
dy du
Therefore, at x, y = f (u) = f (g(x)) is changing du
times as fast as x is changing. That is

where du

Usually, when applying the Chain Rule, we do not introduce symbols to represent the functions
being composed, but rather just proceed to calculate the derivative of the ”outside” function and
then multiply by the derivative of whatever is ”inside.” You can say to yourself: ”the derivative
of f of something is f’ of that thing, multiplied by the derivative of that thing.” This is called the
”Inside-Outside” Rule.

Derivatives of Trigonometric and Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometric functions are important because so much of the phenomena we want information
about are periodic(heart rhythms, earthquakes, tides, weather,etc). Continuous periodic functions
can always be expressed in terms of sines and cosines, so the derivatives of sines and cosines play
an important role in describing important changes.

L’Hôpital’s First Rule for the Indeterminate form 00

Theorem 3.7.1. (L’Hôpital’s First Rule)Suppose that the functions f and g are diﬀerentiable
in a deleted σ− neighborhood (a − σ, a + σ) − {a} (σ > 0) of a point a. Moreover, suppose that

∞

Recall that if two functions f and g are deﬁned in a neighborhood of a pointx = a, such that
(x)
limx→a f (x) = ∞, limx→a g(x) = ∞, then we say that the quotient fg(x)
has the indeterminate

form ∞ at x = a.
Theorem 3.7.5. (L’Hôpital’s Second Rule)Suppose that the functions f and g are diﬀerentiable in a deleted σ− neighborhood (a − σ, a + σ) − {a} (σ > 0) of a point a. Moreover, suppose
that

Indeterminate forms 0.∞, ∞ − ∞, 1∞ , 00 , 0∞ , ∞0

The indeterminate forms 0.∞, ∞ − ∞, 1∞ , 00 , ∞0 can be converted by algebraic substitutions and
tricks into a from of type 00 or ∞
and L’Hôpital’s Rule used to compute them.
∞
Suppose that we try to ﬁnd the limit of y = f (x)g(x) where g(x > 0), when the limits of f and
g as x → a are such that one of the indeterminate forms 1∞ , 00 , 0∞ , ∞0 is produced. First, we
calculate the logarithm:
ln y = g(x) ln f (x).
For each of these three cases, ln y = g(x) ln f (x) has the form 0.∞ as x → a. Thus, it is easy to
see that if
z = p(x)q(x), .........(⋆)
where limx→a p(x) = 0, limx→a q(x) = ∞,
the indeterminate form 0.∞ can be converted by algebraic substitutions into either the form 00 or
∞

z = 1 .......(⋆⋆)

or

we see that (⋆⋆) and (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) have the indeterminate forms 00 and ∞

Diﬀerentiation of Implicit and Parametric Functions

In this section we consider functions deﬁned implicitly and functions deﬁned parametrically.

3.8.1

Implicit Diﬀerentiation

Sometimes we are not given y as a function of x explicitly, but instead have an equation connecting
dy
them which we may be unable to solve explicitly for either x or y. We may still want to ﬁnd dx
.
dy
Example 3.8.1. Find dx
if y 2 = x.

Solution. We diﬀerentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a diﬀerentiable but otherwise unknown function of x. Therefore

Solution. We can not ﬁnd y(x) explicitly in terms of x. We therefore have to use the Chain Rule
to diﬀerentiate the y 2 and y 3 terms and the product rule for the second term involving x and y.
Diﬀerentiating with respect to x, we have
3x2 − 5(x.2y

The gradient at the point (1,2) is then found by substituting these values for x and y the expression, giving −17

Logarithmic Diﬀerentiation

This is an application of implicit diﬀerentiation.
Example 3.8.4. Diﬀerentiate y = xsin x .
Solution. We take logarithms of both sides of the equation to give
ln y = ln(xsin x ) = sin x ln x.

3.8.3

Parametric Diﬀerentiation

Equations of curves are often given parametrically. For example the ellipse is sometimes speciﬁed
by
x = a cos t, y = b sin t, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.
dy
We want to ﬁnd dx
(the gradient), but the parametric equations can only be diﬀerentiated with
respect to t. We can approach this in two ways.
Firstly, we can use the Chain Rule to give

Solution. The gradient is given by

Note that here sin t ̸= 0, and thus t excludes the points 0, ±π, ±2π, ..., where the tangent to the
ellipse is parallel to the y-axis.

Diﬀerentiating Inverse Functions using Implicit Diﬀerentiation

Example 3.8.8. Find the derivative of y = sinh−1 x.

1 = cosh y
so that

hyperbolic identity
cosh2 y − sinh2 y = 1,
gives

√
cosh y = 1 + sinh2 y,

where we use the positive square root because cosh y is always positive. Therefore

CHAPTER 3. DIFFERENTIATION OF FUNCTIONS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE

Linear Approximations and Diﬀerentials

Sometimes we can approximate complicated functions with simpler ones that give the accuracy
we want for speciﬁc applications.

3.9.1

Diﬀerentials

∆y
The Newton quotient ∆x
is a quotient of two quantities ∆y and ∆x. If y is a continuous function
dy
of x, then ∆y → 0 as ∆x → 0, so dx
is the meaningless quantity 00 . We refer to dx as the
diﬀerential of x and dy as the diﬀerential of y as a function of x and dx:

dy =

dy
dx = f ′ (x)dx.
dx

For example, if y = x2 , then dy = 2xdx.
Remark. The diﬀerentials dy and dx were originally regarded (by Leibniz and his successors as
”infinitesimals”(meaning inﬁnitely small but nonzero)). If one quantity, say y, is a function of
another quantity x, that is, y = f (x), we sometimes want to know how a change in the value of x
by an amount ∆x will aﬀect the value of y. The exact change ∆x in y is given by
∆y = f (x + ∆x) − f (x),
but if the change ∆x is small, then we can get a good approximation to ∆y by using the fact that
∆y
dy
is approximately the derivative dx
. Thus
∆x
∆y =

∆y
dy
∆x ≈
∆x = f ′ (x)∆x.
∆x
dx

It is often convenient to represent this approximation in terms of diﬀerentials; if we denote the
change in x by dx instead of ∆x, then the change ∆y in y is approximated by the diﬀerential dy,
that is
∆y ≈ dy = f ′ (x)dx.
Example 3.9.1. Without using a calculator, determine by approximately how much the value
of sin x increases as x increases from π3 to π3 + 0.006. To 3 decimal places, what is the value of
sin( π3 + 0.006)?
Solution. If y = sin x, x = π3 ≈ 1.0472, and dx = 0.006, then
1
π
dy = cos xdx = cos( )dx = (0.006) = 0.003.
3
2
Thus the change in the value of sin x is approximately 0.003, and
√
π
π

sin( + 0.006) ≈ sin( ) + 0.003 =
+ 0.003 = 0.869,

rounded to 3 decimal places.

3.9. LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS AND DIFFERENTIALS

49

Sometimes changes in a quantity are measured with respect to the size of the quantity. The
relative change in x is the ratio dx
if x changes by amount dx. The percentage change in x is the
x
relative change expressed as a percentage:
relative change in x =

dx
x

percentage relative change in x = 100

dx
x

Example 3.9.2. By approximately what percentage does the area of a circle increase if the radius
increases by 2%?
Solution. The area A os a circle is given in terms of radius r by A = πr2 . Thus
∆A ≈ dA =

dA
dr = 2πrdr.
dr

We divide this approximation by A = πr2 to get an approximation that links the relative changes
in A and r:
∆A
dA
2πrdr
dr

2

If r increases by 2%, then dr = 100

Thus, A increases by approximately 4%.

3.9.2

Linearizations are Linear Replacement Formulas

Remark. The tangent to a curve y = f (x) lies close to the curve near the point of tangency. For
a small interval to either side, the y-values along the tangent line give good approximations to the
y-values on the curve. Therefore, to simplify the expression for the function near this point, we
propose to replace the formula for f over this interval by the formula for its tangent line. If the
tangent passes through the point P (a, f (a)) with slope f ′ (a), then its point-slope equation is
y − f (a) = f ′ (a)(x − a)
or
y = f (a) + f ′ (a)(x − a).
, the tangent line is the graph of the function
L(x) = f (a) + f ′ (a)(x − a)..........(⋆)
For as long as the line remains close to the graph of f , L(x) will give a good approximation to f (x).

Example 3.9.3. Find the linearization of f (x) =

√

1 + x at x = 0.

Example 3.9.4. Find the linearization of f (x) = tan x.
Solution. f (x) = tan x, a = 0. Since f (0) = 0, f ′ (0) = sec( 0) = 1, we have L(x) = 0 + 1(x − 0) =
x. Near x = 0
tan x ≈ x.

Deﬁnition 3.9.7. The average rate of change of a function f (x) with respect to x over an
interval from a to a + h is

The (instantaneous) rate of change of f with respect to x at x = a is the derivative

When r = 5 m, the area is changing at the rate of 2π(5) = 10π m2 /min. This means that a small
change ∆r m in the radius when the radius is 5 m would result in a change of about 10π m2 in
the area of the circle.

ANTI-DERIVATIVES OF
FUNCTIONS AND APPLICATIONS
TO AREAS
Throughout Chapter 3 we have been concerned with the problem of ﬁnding the derivative f ′ of
a given function f . The reverse problem-given the derivative f ′ , ﬁnd f -is also interesting and
important. It is the problem studied in integral calculus and is generally more diﬃcult to solve
than the problem of ﬁnding a derivative.

4.1

Anti-Derivatives

We begin by deﬁning an anti derivative of a function f to be a function F whose derivative is f .
It is appropriate to require that F ′ (x) = f (x) on an interval.
Deﬁnition 4.1.1. An antiderivative of a function f on an interval I is another function F
satisfying F ′ (x) = f (x) for x in I. The reverse process of determining F from f is called antidiﬀerentiation or integration.
Remark. Antiderivatives are not unique; indeed, if C is any constant, then F (x) = x+ is an
antiderivative of f (x) = 1 on any interval. You can always add a constant to an antiderivative
F of a function f on an interval and get another antiderivative of f . More importantly, all
antiderivatives of f on an interval can be obtained by adding constants to any particular one. If
F and G are both antiderivatives of I on an interval I, then
d
(G(x) + F (x)) = f (x) − f (x) = 0,
dx
on I, so G(x) − F (x) = C (a constant) on I. Thus G(x) = F (x) + C on I.

4.1.1

Indeﬁnite Integral of a Function

Example 4.1.2. If f (x) is a derivative, the set of all antiderivatives of f is called the indeﬁnite
integral of f , denoted by the symbols
∫
f (x)dx.
55

56 CHAPTER 4. ANTI-DERIVATIVES OF FUNCTIONS AND APPLICATIONS TO AREAS
∫
The sign is called an integral sign. The function f is the integrand of the integral and x is
the variable of integration.
Remark. We have already seen that all the anti-derivatives F of f diﬀer by a constant. We
indicate this by writing
∫
f (x)dx = F (x) + C.

(⋆)

The constant C is called the constant of integration. Equation (⋆) is read as ”The indeﬁnite
integral of f with respect to x is F (x) + C”. When we ﬁnd F (x) + C, we say that we have evaluated the indeﬁnite integral.

This section is completely concerned with how to evaluate integrals.

4.2.1

Integration by Substitution

A change of variable can often turn an unfamiliar integral into one we can evaluate. The method
of doing this is called the Substitution Method.

Integration by Parts

Our next general method for anti-diﬀerentiation is called Integration by Parts. Just as the
method of substitution can be regarded as inverse to the Chain Rule for diﬀerentiation, so the
method for integration by parts is inverse to the Product Rule for diﬀerentiation. Suppose that
U (x) and V (x) are two diﬀerentiable functions. According to the Product Rule,
)
d(
dV
dU
U (x).V (x) = U (x)
+ V (x) .
dx
dx
dx
Integrating both sides of this equation and transposing terms yields
∫
∫
dU
dV
U (x) dx = U (x)V (x) − V (x) dx,
dx
dx
or more simply,

∫

∫
U dV = U V −

V dU.

In each application of the method, we break up the given
∫ integrand into a product of two
pieces, U and V ′ , where∫ V ′ is readily integrated and where V U ′ dx is usually (but not always)
a simpler integral than U V ′ dx. The technique is called integration by parts because it replaces
one integral with the sum of an integrated term and another integral that remains to be evaluated.
That is, it accomplishes only part of the original integration.

4.2. TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION

xex dx.

Solution. Let U = x, dv = ex dx. Then dU = dx and V = ex . Thus
∫
∫
x
x
xe dx = xe − ex dx = xex − ex + C.
Note: In general, do not include a constant of integration with V or on the right-hand side until
the last integral has been evaluated.
Choices should be made for U and dV in various situations. An improper choice can result in
making an integral more diﬃcult rather than easier. Look for a factor of the integrand that is
easily integrated, and include dx with that factor to make up dV . Then V is the remaining factor
of the integrand. Sometimes it is necessary to take dV = dx only. When breaking up an integrand
using integration by parts, choose U and dV so that, if possible, V dU is ”simpler ” (easier to
integrate) than U dV .

Remark. The following are two useful rules of thumb for choosing U and dV :
(i) If the integrand involves a polynomial multiplied by an exponential, a sine or a cosine, or
some other readily integrable function, try U equals the polynomial and dV equals the rest.
(ii) If the integrand involves a logarithm, an inverse trigonometric function, or some other
function that is not readily integrable but whose derivative is readily calculated, try that function
for U and let d V equal the rest.
(Of course, these ”rules” come with no guarantee. They may fail to be helpful if ”the rest” is
not of a suitable form. There remain many functions that cannot be anti-diﬀerentiated by any
2
standard techniques; e.g., ex .)
The following two examples illustrate a frequently occurring and very useful phenomenon. It
may happen after one or two integrations by parts, with the possible application of some known
identity, that the original integral reappears on the right-hand side. Unless its coeﬃcient there is
1, we have an equation that can be solved for that integral.
∫
Example 4.2.9. Evaluate I = sec3 xdx
Solution. We start by integrating by parts: let U = sec x, dV = sec2 xdx. Then dU =
sec x tan xdx, V = tan x. Thus

Integration of Rational Functions

In this subsection we are concerned with integrals of the form
∫
P (x)
dx,
Q(x)
where P and Q are polynomials in x. We need normally concern ourselves only with rational
P (x)
functions Q(x)
where the degree of P is less than that of Q. If the degree of P equals or exceeds
P (x)
the degree of Q, then we can use ”long division” to express the fraction Q(x)
as a polynomial
R(x)
plus another fraction Q(x)
, where R, the remainder in the division, has degree less than that of Q.
Without loss of generality(WLOG), we will also consider the case where P (x) and Q(x) has no
common roots.

Deﬁnition 4.2.11. If the degree of the numerator P (x) is less than that of the denominator Q(x),
P (x)
then we say that the rational function Q(x)
is a proper function.
Example 4.2.12. Evaluate

• Suppose that Q(x) is quadratic,i.e. of degree 2. For purposes of this discussion we can assume
that Q(x) is either of the form x2 +a2 or x2 −a2 , since completing the square and making change of
variable can always reduce a quadratic to this form. Since P (x) can be at most a linear function,
P (x) = Ax + B, we are led to consider the following four integrals

The technique used above, involving the writing of a complicated fraction as a sum of simpler
fractions, is called the Method of Partial Fractions. Suppose that a polynomial Q(x) is of
degree n and that its highest degree term is xn (with coeﬃcient 1). Suppose also that Q factors
into a product of n distinct linear (degree 1) factors, say,
Q(x) = (x − a1 )(x − a2 )...(x − an ),
P (x)
where ai ̸= aj if i ̸= j, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. If P (x) is a polynomial of degree smaller than n, then Q(x)
has a partial fraction decomposition of the form

Denominators with Repeated Factors
We require one ﬁnal reﬁnement of the method of partial fractions. If any of the linear or quadratic
P (x)
factors of Q(x) is repeated (say, m times), then the partial fraction decomposition of Q(x)
requires
m distinct fractions corresponding to that factor. The denominators of these fractions have exponents increasing from 1 to m, and the numerators are all constants where the repeated factor is
linear or linear where the repeated factor is quadratic.

• If x ≥ a, then 0 ≤ θ = sec−1 xa = cosa x < π2 , and tan θ ≥ 0.
• If x ≤ −a, then π2 < θ = sec−1 xa = cosa x ≤ π, and tan θ ≤ 0.

Inverse Hyperbolic Substitutions

As an alternative to the inverse secant substitution x = a sec θ to simplify integrals involving
√
x2 − a2 (where x ≥ a > 0) we can use the inverse hyperbolic
cosine substitution x = a cosh u.
√
2
2

Since cosh u − 1 = sinh u, this substitution produces x − a = a sinh u. To express u in terms
of x, we need the result, note that

cosh−1 x = ln(x + x2 − 1), x ≥ 1.

Solution. Note that this problem has been solved using the inverse secant substitution. Again
we assume x ≥ a(the case where x ≤ −1 can be handled similarly.) Using the substitution

There is a certain special substitution that can transform an integral whose integrand is a rational
function of sinθ and cosθ (i.e., a quotient of polynomials in sinθ and cosθ into a rational function

The Deﬁnite Integral

∫b
The deﬁnite integral of f (x) over [a, b], denoted by a f (x)dx is a number; it is not a function of
x. It depends on the numbers a and b and on the particular function f , but not on the variable
x. It is deﬁned
∫
b

f (x)dx = [F (x) + C]|ba = F (b) − F (a),
a

where F is an antiderivative of f .

Deﬁnition 4.3.1. Let f (x) be a function whose domain contains the closed interval [a, b]. Suppose
F (x)
∫ nis an antiderivative for f (x). Then the deﬁnite integral of f (x) from x = a to x = b, denoted
by a f (x)dx is deﬁned as
∫ b
f (x)dx = [F (x) + C]|x=b
x=a = F (b) − F (a).
a

Here, a is called the lower bound/limit of integration and b is called the upper bound/limit
of integration.
Observe that the diﬀerence F (b) − F (a) does not depend on C, because
(F (b) + C) − (F (a) + C) = F (b) − F (a).
Formula (⋆) is called
∫ a the Newton-Leibniz formula. Note that in (⋆) if a = b, then the integral
is zero. That is a f (x)dx = 0.
The techniques of integration can be used to evaluate deﬁnite integrals.

Applications of the Deﬁnite Integral

We give concepts of length, area and volume analytic deﬁnitions using the concept of the deﬁnite
integral.

4.4.1

Area and the Deﬁnite Integral

Area as a Limit
Let f be a continuous, positive valued function on [a, b] and suppose we want to compute the
area of f under the graph of f from x = a to x = b. We may approximate the area by partitioning
the region into n trapezia (subdivide [a, b] into n equal intervals each of length ∆x) and ﬁnding
the area of each trapezia and add the areas up.
A = lim (

n
∑

n→∞

f (xi )∆x),

i=1

where ∆x = b−a
and xi is the right-hand endpoint of the ith interval [xi−1 , xi ].
n
Note that the deﬁnite integral exists if the limit is a ﬁnite number. The actual area A is given by
the deﬁnite integral
∫
b

A=

f (x)dx.

(⋆).

a

Note that the approximation to area approaches the actual area as n → ∞. Thus
∫ b
A=

n
∑
f (x)dx = lim (
f (xi )∆x).
n→∞

a

i=1

It can be shown that the partitioning points xi need not be equally spaced as long as the longest
interval nears zero as n increases without bound. The deﬁnite integral deﬁned here is called a
Riemann integral.
If f (x) < 0 on [a, b], then the integral (⋆) is a non-positive number,−A. Since the area is nonnegative, we deﬁne
∫
b

|f (x)|dx.

A=
a

72 CHAPTER 4. ANTI-DERIVATIVES OF FUNCTIONS AND APPLICATIONS TO AREAS
Let f1 , f2 be continuous functions with f1 (x) ≥ f (x2 ) for x ∈ [a, b]. Then the area A of the region
bounded by the curves y = f1 (x) and y = f2 (x) and the vertical lines x = a, x = b is
∫ b
[f (x) − g(x)]dx

A=

(⋆⋆)

a

More generally, consider a continuous function f with a graph that crosses the x-axis at ﬁnitely
many points xi , i = 1, 2, ..., k between a and b. Then we write
∫ b
∫ b
∫ x1

a f (x)dx + · · · +

∫b
Hence, we see that a f (x)dx is equal to the area under y = f (x) above the x-axis, minus the area
over y = f (x) below the x-axis.
Finally, let f1 , f2 be continuous, with f1 (y) ≥ f2 (y) for y ∈ [c, d]. Then the area A of the region
bounded by the curves x = f1 (y) and x = f2 (y) and the vertical lines y = c and y = d is
∫ d
[f1 (y) − f2 (y)]dy.

Example 4.4.1. Find the area A of the region bounded by the curves y = xα and x = y α .

Example 4.4.4. Find the area A of the region bounded by the x-axis and f (x) = x2 + x − 6.
Solution. The zeros of f (x) = x2 + x − 6 are (−3, 0) and (2, 0). Since the x axis has equation
y = 0, the desired area can be considered as the area of a region between the two curves y = 0

From the graph, part of the region falls below the x-axis and part above. Note that

Summary. The area of a region bounded by two or more curves can be found by integration.
The integrand is g(x) − f (x) when g(x) ≥ f (x) for all x in the interval of integration. The bounds
of integration are usually found by determining the points of intersection of the curves. In some
cases it may be necessary to use more than one integral. If f (x) or (g(x) − f (x)) crosses the x-axis
in [a, b], then more than one integral may be necessary.
